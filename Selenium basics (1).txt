Automation Testing:
Testing an applications features with the help of automation tool and executing test scripts is called automation testing.


Disadvantages of Manual Testing:
1. Compatibility testing is difficult
2. Test cycle duration will be is increased
3. More human efforts are required
4. Regression testing is time consuming


Advantages of automation testing
1. Reusability of test script
2. Compatibility testing is easy/possible
3. Project duration will be reduced
4. Less human efforts are required
5. To overcome drawback of regression testing
6. Cost of project will be reduced
7. It is reliable and efficient


Some of the automation tools
1. Selenium
2. atp
3. sahi / sahipro
4. selendroid
5. appium


When we should do automation testing?


Advantages of selenium
1. Open Source
2. Multi Language Supportable
3. Cross Browser / Compatibility Testing Possible
4. Cross Platform is Also Possible


Disadvantages of selenium
1. We Can Automate Web Based Application
2. We Can Not Automate Standalone Application
3. Can Not Automate Captcha
4. Can Not Read/Scan Barcode
5. Selenium Will Not Support File Uploading(Using 3rd party tool)



Java concept used in Automation
1. Control Statements 
2. Loops 
3. Inheritance
4. Polymorphism
5. Interface 
6. Arrays 
7. Casting (Up Casting) 
8. Abstraction 
9. Encapsulation
10. String 
11. Collection


Selenium Tool Suite/flavor/components:

1. Selenium Integrated Development Environment (IDE) 
a) We can run script in only Firefox browser 
b) Record and playback options 
c) We can not do compatibility testing

2. Selenium Remote Control (Now Deprecated) 
a) Support compatibility testing (cross browser) 
b) We can write scripts in java only 

3. Selenium WebDriver:Version 4.4.0 
a) Support compatibility testing (cross browser) 
b) We can write scripts in multiple languages 
4. Selenium Grid 
5. Selendroid 


Selenium architechture:

1. Search context is a super most interface which contains abstract methods & inherited to web driver.
2. Web driver is an interface which contains abstract method of search context and its own abstract methods.
3. All the abstract methods are overridden or implemented in selenium remote web driver class.
4. Selenium remote web driver-it is class which implements all the abstract methods of both interface (search context and web driver).
5. Selenium remote driver class is extended to browsers such as Firefox, internet explorer, chrome…..etc.




1) Web Driver- it is an interface used to perform action on browser

Using web driver to perform following actions on browsers-
1. Enter url
2. Maximize and minimize
3. Current tab close
4. Multiple tab close at a time

webDriver Methods:
1. get()
a) This method is used to open an application or to enter url on the webpage

2. Close()
a) This method is used to close current tab of the browser

3. quit()
a) This method is the alternate method to the close method
b) But the difference between the close and quit is that close() method close the current tab only & quit() method will close all the tabs of the browser.

4. navigate()
a) This method is to open an application, move forward, backward and refresh the browser.
b) Navigate method can be used for alternate method for get method

5.getTitle()
a) This method is used to get title of the web page as an output

6. getCurrentUrl()
a)This method is used to get url of the current web page as an output.

7.maximize()
a) This method is used to maximize the browser

8.minimize()
a) This method is used to minimize the browser

9.setSize()
a) this method is use to change size of the browser which accepts dimensions arguments
b) setSize() method can’t accept directly the width and height of the browser. This method accept only dimension arguments.

10.getSize();
a)Used to check the browser size immediately after opening of the browser
b)return dimension arguments in terms of width and height.

11.setPosition()
a) This method is used to change position of the browser which accept point argument

12.getPosition()
a) check the position of the browser in terms of x and y coordinates
b) returns point arguments in terms of x and y coordinates
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tagname
a) Any keyword which is present immediately after angular brace(<) less than symbol
Eg. html, title, body, tr, table

2. Attribute
a) Any keyword which is present immediately after tagname with equal to symbol until greater than symbol
b) Attribute name = attribute value
Eg. type=’text’ , id=’1234’, class=’abc’, name=’xyz’

3. Text
a)Any keyword which is present in between angular brace(>) greater than symbol & angular brace (<) less than symbol is known as Text
Eg. >sr no<, >link<, >manual<, >java<

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

*Locators:

a) Locators are used to identify an element with the help of locator types.

b) To identify an element present on the webpage, we need to use ‘findElement’ method which is present in web driver

c)findElement method identifies an element with the help of By class which contains Static methods

d)All the static methods present in By class are known as locator types


*Locator types:

1. Tagname -->tagname
2. Id -->attribute
3. Name-->attribute
4. ClassName -->attribute
5. Linktext -->text
6. Partial linktext -->text
7. Css selector -->expression
8. Xpath-->expression


*Types of Xpath:

1. Xpath by Attribute
2. Xpath by text
3. Xpath by contains
4. Xpath by index 
5. Absolute xpath
6. Relative Xpath 

1. Xpath by Attribute-
Syntax: //tagname[@attribute name = 'attribute value']

2. Xpath by text-
Syntax: //Tagname[text()=’text value’]

3. Xpath by contains-
	a) Xpath by contains using two ways:
		1. Xpath by contains by using attributes
		2. Xpath by contains by using text

	1. Xpath by contains by using attributes-
	syntax: //tagname[contains(@attribute name,’attribute value’)]

	2. Xpath by contains by using text-
	syntax://tagname[contains(text(),’text value’)]


4. Xpath by index-
Syntax = (xpath expression)[index]


5. Absolute xpath:
a) Absolute xpath is used to navigate form root of the parent to immediate child.
b) To achieve absolute xpath we need to use single forward slash (/).
Examples:
 
UN:/html/body/div[1]/input[1]
	 
Contact:/html/body/div[2]/input[3]
	 
Login:/html/body/div[3]/button


Disadvantages of Absolute xpath:
a) Xpath is too lengthy and time consuming.
b) Identify of an element by developing html tree diagram is difficult.


6. Relative xpath:
a) Relative xpath is used to navigate form root of the parent to any child.
b) To achieve relative xpath we need to use double forward slash (//).

Examples: 
UN://div[1]/input[1] or //div[1]//input[1]                 

Contact://div[2]/input[3] or //div[2]//input[3]             
 
Login://div[3]/button or //button

Disadvantages of Relative xpath:
a) Identify of an element by developing html tree diagram is difficult.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Web elements and its methods:

a) Webelement- It is an interface used to perform action on element present in a browser

Webelement Methods-

1. sendKeys():
a) This method is used to enter value in the input field.

2. clear():
a) This method is used to clear value in the text field.

3. click ():
a) Click method is use to click on button, link also use to select radio buttons and check box.

4. getText():

b) Return type of getText function is String

5. isEnabled():
a) This method is used to verify element is enabled or disabled.
b) Return type of isenabled function boolean.
c) If element is enabled then it returns true otherwise it returns false


6. isSelected():
a) This method is used to verify radio button/checkbox is selected or not.
b) Return type of isSelected function is boolean.
c) If radio button/checkbox is selected then it returns true otherwise it returns false.

7. isDisplayed():
a) This method is used to verify element is present or not.
b) Return type of isDisplayed function is boolean.
c) If element is present then it returns true otherwise it returns exception.
